# Communicating Data Findings using Explanatory Visualizations

**Overview:**
Using Ford Bike share data to create exploratory and exploratory data analysis and sharing the findings in interactive HTML format.

In the first part, I've used python visualization libraries to systematically explore the dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I've created a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered during the analysis of dataset. Finally, analysis is conveyed through transforming exploratory visualizations and explanatory visualizations.

**Exploratory Analysis and Visualization**: Univariate (Bar Charts, Pie Charts and Histograms), Bivariate (Violin plots, Countplots) and Multivariate (Heat Map) Exploration of data. (Exploratory_Analysis_Visualization.ipynb)

**Exploratory Visualization**: (Explanatory_Visualization_Slide_Deck.ipynb)


**Analysis Summary**
- Bikes are used mostly between 5 minutes and 20 minutes
- Most of shared bikes travelled between 0.5 Kilometers to 2 Kilometers
- 89.13% of user base is Subscriber (Users with a membership) and remaining 10.87% is Customers (Users without any membership)
- Male vs Female Users: 76.7% users are Male and 21.9% are Females. For Subscribers, the result is similar i.e., number of bike trips are much larger for Males than Females.
- Mostly people are renting bikes during Weekdays than weekends with most common age period is people in 30s.
- Weekday vs Weekend: Subscribers use the bike sharing system mainly on weekdays. Customers use the bike sharing system more often on weekends
- Customers trips are usually longer than for Subscribers most probably as they prefer bike rides occasionally around weekends
- Highest duration of Customers are of 500 to 1000s and ages are between 30 - 35 years. Highest duration of Subscribers are starting from 0s to 500s and ages are between 30 - 35 years.
